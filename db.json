Living in beautiful houses inside the picturesque landscape of the desert is a dream everyone doesn’t get the chance to materialise. It is a lovely expression of forms and materials, brilliantly placed to form crevices cooled by shade and plantation, exactly mimicking the desert topography.",

      "description": "The extraordinary design of this house was inspired by the concept of ‘family archaeology’, where children continue to enjoy the warmth and love of their family even when they grow independent. The fluid shape and minimalistic construction signify how families grow and expand without separating from the primary source. With an area of 6,900 sq. metres, the dwelling has four bedrooms and a vast dining area for those big family meals together, and it also houses a pool to chill out and relax. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best houses to live in for those families who want to grow together.",

However, its beauty does not lie in its covertness but in its minimal invasiveness and temperature maintenance capability. Though it is hidden from passers-by, the residents of this beautiful 3-bedroom apartment can have a clear view of the entire coastline. The bathrooms are made of vibrant coloured pods and are complete with suits.",
